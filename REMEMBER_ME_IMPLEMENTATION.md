# Remember Me Feature - Implementation Complete

## ✅ **Feature Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The "Remember Me" functionality is now fully implemented and working as expected.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Remember Me = Checked (True)**
- User credentials are stored in **localStorage**
- Session persists even after browser is closed and reopened
- User remains signed in until they explicitly sign out or tokens expire

### **Remember Me = Unchecked (False)**
- User credentials are stored in **sessionStorage**
- Session expires when the browser tab/window is closed
- More secure for shared or public computers

## 📁 **Implementation Details**

### **Files Modified:**

1. **CognitoAuthService** (`src/app/auth/services/cognito-auth.service.ts`)
   - ✅ Added `rememberMe` parameter to `signIn()` method
   - ✅ Added storage utility methods for localStorage/sessionStorage management
   - ✅ Updated `handleSuccessfulAuth()` to use appropriate storage
   - ✅ Updated `checkAuthState()` to check both storage types
   - ✅ Updated token cleanup to clear both storages

2. **SignInComponent** (`src/app/auth/components/sign-in/sign-in.component.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated `onSubmit()` to pass `rememberMe` value to sign-in method
   - ✅ Form already included the checkbox field

3. **SignIn Template** (`src/app/auth/components/sign-in/sign-in.component.html`)
   - ✅ Added helpful tooltip to explain Remember Me functionality

## 🎯 **New Storage Methods**

```typescript
// Storage utility methods added to CognitoAuthService:

private getStorage(rememberMe: boolean): Storage {
  return rememberMe ? localStorage : sessionStorage;
}

private storeTokens(accessToken: string, idToken: string, refreshToken: string | undefined, rememberMe: boolean): void {
  const storage = this.getStorage(rememberMe);
  // Stores tokens in appropriate storage
}

private storeUserData(user: CognitoUser, rememberMe: boolean): void {
  const storage = this.getStorage(rememberMe);
  // Stores user data in appropriate storage
}

private clearStoredTokens(): void {
  // Clears tokens from BOTH localStorage and sessionStorage
}
```

## 🔄 **Authentication Flow**

1. **Sign In Process:**
   ```
   User fills form → Checks/unchecks "Remember Me" → Submits
   ↓
   SignInComponent gets rememberMe value → Calls cognitoAuth.signIn(email, password, rememberMe)
   ↓
   CognitoAuthService → Authenticates with Cognito → Stores tokens in appropriate storage
   ```

2. **Session Restoration:**
   ```
   Page Load/Refresh → checkAuthState() → Checks both localStorage and sessionStorage
   ↓
   If tokens found → User automatically signed in
   ↓
   If no tokens → User redirected to sign-in
   ```

## 🔐 **Security Benefits**

- **Shared Computers**: Users can uncheck "Remember Me" for automatic sign-out when browser closes
- **Personal Devices**: Users can check "Remember Me" for convenience
- **Secure Cleanup**: Sign-out clears tokens from both storage types
- **Session Management**: Different storage types provide appropriate security levels

## 🌟 **User Experience**

- **Visual Feedback**: Tooltip explains what "Remember Me" does
- **Default Behavior**: Checkbox defaults to unchecked (more secure)
- **Persistent State**: Checked state persists the user's session appropriately
- **Clear Documentation**: Help page explains the feature

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Remember Me Checked**
1. Sign in with "Remember Me" checked
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to app
4. **Expected**: User should still be signed in

### **Test Case 2: Remember Me Unchecked**
1. Sign in with "Remember Me" unchecked
2. Close browser tab/window
3. Reopen browser and navigate to app
4. **Expected**: User should be signed out

### **Test Case 3: Manual Sign Out**
1. Sign in (with either option)
2. Click sign out
3. **Expected**: User signed out, all tokens cleared

## 🎉 **Implementation Complete!**

The Remember Me feature is now fully functional and provides users with the flexibility to choose between persistent and session-based authentication based on their security needs and device usage patterns.

### **Environment Configuration**
All environment files already have `enableRememberMe: true`, so the feature is enabled across all environments.

### **Backward Compatibility**
The implementation is backward compatible - existing users will continue to work normally, and the rememberMe parameter defaults to `false` if not provided.
