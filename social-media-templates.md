### Professional Announcement
🚀 Excited to share a new open-source project that's been months in the making!

As developers, we often spend weeks setting up the same foundational features for every new Angular project - authentication, user management, theming, responsive design. 

So I built a comprehensive starter template that handles all of this:

🔐 Production-ready AWS Cognito authentication
🎨 Complete dark/light theme system  
📱 Mobile-first responsive design
🛡️ Enterprise security patterns
⚡ Modern Angular 19 architecture

The goal? Get from idea to MVP in hours, not weeks.

It's completely free and open source. Would love your feedback from the Angular community!

### Technical Deep Dive
💡 Lessons learned building a production-ready Angular starter:

After maintaining enterprise Angular apps for years, I noticed we rebuild the same patterns repeatedly:

1️⃣ Authentication flows with proper error handling
2️⃣ Theme systems that actually work on mobile  
3️⃣ Route guards that don't break user experience
4️⃣ Form validation that feels natural
5️⃣ Loading states that provide meaningful feedback

The challenge wasn't just building these features - it was making them work together seamlessly.

Key insights:
• AWS Cognito over Firebase for enterprise readiness
• CSS custom properties for maintainable theming  
• Standalone components for better tree-shaking
• inject() pattern for cleaner dependency injection

Built all of this into an open-source starter template. 

What patterns do you find yourself rebuilding most often?
