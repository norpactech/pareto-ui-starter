Hey r/Angular! 👋

I got tired of spending 2-3 weeks on every new project setting up authentication, theming, and user management, so I built a comprehensive Angular starter that handles all of this.

## What's Included:
✅ **AWS Cognito authentication** (sign up, sign in, password reset, email verification)  
✅ **Complete user management** with profile system  
✅ **Dark/light theme** with system preference detection  
✅ **Material Design** with custom green theme  
✅ **Mobile-responsive** with hamburger navigation  
✅ **Route guards** and HTTP interceptors  
✅ **Modern Angular 19** with standalone components  
✅ **TypeScript strict mode** throughout  

## Live Demo & Code:
🌐 **Demo**: https://your-demo-url.netlify.app  
📦 **GitHub**: https://github.com/your-username/pareto-ui-starter  

## Quick Start:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pareto-ui-starter.git
cd pareto-ui-starter && npm install
# Add your AWS Cognito settings to environment files
npm start
```

The auth system is production-ready (not just mock data) and includes everything you need for a real app. The theming system automatically generates all color variations and handles smooth transitions.

**Looking for feedback on:**
- What other features would be useful in a starter?
- Any Angular best practices I might have missed?
- Interest in additional integrations (Stripe, multi-tenancy, etc.)?

Built this to save time on my own projects but figured the community might find it useful too. It's completely free and open source.

What do you think? Would love your thoughts! 🚀
